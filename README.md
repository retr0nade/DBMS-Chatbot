## üí¨ Example Queries

```sql
-- SQL
SELECT name FROM Students WHERE marks > (SELECT AVG(marks) FROM Students);

-- MongoDB
db.students.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: null, avgMarks: { $avg: "$marks" } } },
  { $lookup: {
      from: "students",
      pipeline: [
        { $match: { $expr: { $gt: ["$marks", "$$avgMarks"] } } }
      ],
      as: "aboveAverageStudents"
    }
  }
])
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Requires internet for API-based LLMs
- Not connected to a live database (currently text-based simulation)
- May hallucinate syntax/theory if asked something obscure or unsupported

---

## üß† To-Do

- [ ] Add support for live SQL execution using SQLite or Postgres
- [ ] GUI frontend using Streamlit or Flask
- [ ] Conversation memory for follow-up queries
- [ ] Upload schema or table for context-aware querying
